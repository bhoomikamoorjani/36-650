# Question 1
# Since these Agile story values are going to be searched several times, 
# I would store them in a tuple as tuples are more effecient than lists in terms of average item look-up time. 
# Furthermore, since these values won't be changed once stored, the lack of mutability of tuples won't be an issue.
